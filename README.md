# This is an Implementation of Multiclass Classification with Neural Network from Scratch with OOP in Python

## 1. Introduction

In this notebook, I implement the training of Neural Network for multiclass classification with Object Oriented programming. The following functions are implemented within the class:

- Initialisation of the weights 
- feedforward Propagation 
- backward propagation
- prediction

the loss function is cross entropy for multiclass classification. 

The neural network is trained on the Iris dataset. With this neural network, I achieve a very good performance on the test set. 

It has to be mentioned that the neural network can be further generalized to accomodate different configuration of hyperparameters.
